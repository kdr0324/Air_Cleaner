#Air_Cleaner

Hi, My name is Dae Ryong Kim in Seoul Korea.

I Will Make Air Cleaner using raspberry pi 3

first i use temperature, humidity and dust sensor for checking air condition.

If dust density is higher than threshold, cooling fan(connected raspberry pi) is going to work.

And periodically air condition information will be writed on MySQL Server (in raspberry pi)

The information writed DB Sever can read web service. I use node.js for web service.

And this system can remote control through Android Application.

I want addition function in this Android App like voic recognition.

Thank you
